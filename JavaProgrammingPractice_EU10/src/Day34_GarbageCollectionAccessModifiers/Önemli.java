    //dakika 8 34 gün the differences are between static and instance variable ,will be explained in 8min
    //static expects no instance variable
    //in order to access to instance method you have to create object
    //static block: it's a set of instruction that is run only once when a class is loaded into memory
    //A static block is also called static initialization block
    //what is the difference between static import regular import?
    //Answer:regular import:import packageName.className;
    //import packageNmae.*;
    //regular import it contains all the things in the class
    //if the class is in another package in order to import the class you have to write
    // import day34_GarbageCollection_AccessModifiers.Circle; should be written(it's just an example for it)
    // But you don't need every static members in your class that is the time then to use static import
